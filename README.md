# Taskwise Finances
Managing personal finances can be a daunting task, especially for those who are not familiar with financial management. To address this problem, we have developed a web application called Taskwise Finances. This application is designed to help users manage their finances in an efficient and user-friendly way.

## Features
Clean and Intuitive Interface: Taskwise Finances offers a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to navigate and understand the application.

* **Calendar:** The application provides a calendar view that allows users to track their financial activities on specific dates. Users can easily view their expenses, bills, and income for each day, week, or month.

* **Expense Tracking:** Users can effortlessly track their expenses by adding them to the application. They can categorize expenses, add descriptions, and specify the amount spent. Taskwise Finances will provide an overview of all expenses, helping users analyze their spending habits.

## Technologies Used
